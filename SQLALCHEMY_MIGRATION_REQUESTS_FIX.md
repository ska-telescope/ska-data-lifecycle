# SQLAlchemy Migration for dlm_migration_requests.py

This document describes the changes made to migrate the `dlm_migration_requests.py` file from using PostgREST to directly accessing the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.

## Changes Made

### Import Statement Update

The import statement for the database access layer was updated from:

```python
from ..dlm_db.db_access import DB
```

to:

```python
from ..dlm_db.db_access_sqlalchemy import DB
```

This change ensures that the `dlm_migration_requests.py` file now uses the SQLAlchemy implementation of the database access layer instead of the old PostgREST implementation.

## Analysis

### Database Interactions

The `dlm_migration_requests.py` file has several functions that interact with the database:

1. `update_migration_statuses()` - Uses `DB.select()` to query incomplete migrations and `DB.update()` to update their status
2. `query_migrations()` - Uses `DB.select()` to query migrations with various filters
3. `_get_migration_record()` - Uses `DB.select()` to get a specific migration record
4. `_create_migration_record()` - Uses `DB.insert()` to create a new migration record

### Complex Logical Operators

The file uses complex logical operators in the `query_migrations()` function:

```python
# AND operator with nested conditions
params["and"] = f"(date.gte.{start_date},date.lte.{end_date})"

# OR operator with nested conditions
params["or"] = f"(source_storage_id.eq.{storage_id},destination_storage_id.eq.{storage_id})"
```

These complex logical operators are already supported by the SQLAlchemy implementation as documented in `SQLALCHEMY_MIGRATION.md`, so no changes were needed for these patterns.

### Interface Compatibility

No other changes were needed because:

1. **Same Interface**: The interface of the `DB` methods (`select()`, `update()`, `insert()`) is the same in both implementations, so the code can use them without changes.
2. **Complex Logical Operators**: The SQLAlchemy implementation already supports the complex logical operators used in this file.
3. **No Dictionary-to-JSON Conversions**: There are no dictionary-to-JSON conversions in the code that would need special handling.
4. **Row Mapping Handled Internally**: The SQLAlchemy implementation already handles row mapping internally, so no changes are needed to access the result rows.

## Verification

The changes were verified by:

1. **Static Analysis**: The code was analyzed to ensure that it would work correctly with the SQLAlchemy implementation.
2. **Interface Verification**: The interface of the `DB` methods was verified to be the same in both implementations.
3. **Complex Logical Operators**: The support for complex logical operators in the SQLAlchemy implementation was verified.

## Conclusion

The migration of `dlm_migration_requests.py` from PostgREST to SQLAlchemy was completed successfully with minimal changes. The only change needed was to update the import statement to use the SQLAlchemy implementation of the database access layer.

This change is part of the larger effort to migrate the SKA Data Lifecycle Management system from using PostgREST to directly accessing the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, as described in the `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` document.
