# SQLAlchemy Row Mapping Fix

## Issue Description

When running tests, the following error was encountered at line 301 of `db_access_sqlalchemy.py`:

```
TypeError: cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence
```

## Root Cause

The error occurred in the SQLAlchemy database access implementation when trying to convert SQLAlchemy result rows to dictionaries. The code was using `dict(row)` to convert result rows, but in SQLAlchemy 2.0, result rows cannot be directly converted to dictionaries using this method.

In SQLAlchemy 2.0, result rows need to be accessed using the `_mapping` attribute first, which provides a mapping interface that can then be converted to a dictionary.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. In the `insert` method (line 301):
   ```python
   # Before
   rows = [dict(row) for row in result]
   
   # After
   rows = [dict(row._mapping) for row in result]
   ```

2. In the `update` method (line 355):
   ```python
   # Before
   rows = [dict(row) for row in result]
   
   # After
   rows = [dict(row._mapping) for row in result]
   ```

3. In the `select` method (line 384):
   ```python
   # Before
   rows = [dict(row) for row in result]
   
   # After
   rows = [dict(row._mapping) for row in result]
   ```

## Explanation

In SQLAlchemy 2.0, the result rows returned by `session.execute()` are `Row` objects that implement a mapping interface through the `_mapping` attribute. This attribute provides access to the column values by name, which can then be converted to a dictionary using `dict()`.

The previous code was trying to directly convert the `Row` objects to dictionaries using `dict(row)`, which caused the TypeError because `Row` objects in SQLAlchemy 2.0 are not directly convertible to dictionaries.

By using `dict(row._mapping)` instead, we correctly access the mapping interface of the `Row` objects before converting them to dictionaries, which resolves the TypeError.
