ska_dlm Package
===============
This is the autogenerated Python package level documentation of the SKA Data Lifecycle Management system. Using this pacckage requires it to be installed inside a virtual environment. The ska_dlm is using the poetry package manager and thus installation is pretty straight foward:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd ska_data_lifecycle
   $ poetry install
   $ poetry shell

Then the package can be imported into python:

.. code:: python

   >>> import ska_dlm
   >>> print(ska_dlm.__doc__)
